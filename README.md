# Life in Shot


### About the project

Hey ! `Life Is Shot` is a project made me (Anh-Jo[https://github.com/Anh-Jo]) for my girlfriend. 
The idea is born because we met a problem on Instagram App : we can't share pictures only for us, or our family.
Everything is public, sponsored. 

The concept is to take all the good part of the most famous social app, and merge them in a new and (maybe) better app.

### How it works

In this app, you can post what we called `Story` or `Moments`, a combination of a title, picture and a description. By default, this is private.

If you want to share it to some people, two options : `public` or in some `groups`

You said Groups ? YES !

You can create `Group`, add some members and then, share your stories.

If you want to make it visible for all the world, just compute it to public. 


### Roadmap

It'll come later...
